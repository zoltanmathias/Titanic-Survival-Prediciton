# Titanic-Survival-Prediciton
Predicting whether a person survived the legendary sinking of the Titanic

With the use of Python and its associated machine learning libraries, this code aims to predict whether a passenger on the ship survived.
This is done with the use of personal data of the passengers and their fate (whether they survived or not).
The features in the data include information such as the sex, age, societal class, fare, family on board, and a few more.
Seaborn was used to visualize the data and eliminate features that did not contribute to the overall prediction.
